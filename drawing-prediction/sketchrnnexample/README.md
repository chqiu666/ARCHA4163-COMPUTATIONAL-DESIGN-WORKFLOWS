## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Drawing
1. **Start Drawing**: Click/touch and drag on the canvas
2. **AI Completion**: Stop drawing and watch AI complete your sketch
3. **Continue Drawing**: Add more strokes and AI will adapt
4. **Clear & Restart**: Use the clear button to start fresh

### Model Selection
1. Choose from 12+ different categories (bird, cat, dog, etc.)
2. Each model is trained on specific types of drawings
3. Switch models anytime to change AI behavior
4. Model loading status shown in top status bar

### Creativity Control
1. **Temperature Slider**: Adjust from 0.1 (predictable) to 1.0 (creative)
2. **Lower Values**: More realistic, expected drawings
3. **Higher Values**: More abstract, surprising results
4. **Real-time Updates**: Changes affect immediate AI generation

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **C**: Clear canvas
- **R**: Generate random drawing
- **S**: Save current drawing
- **H**: Toggle help panel
- **Space**: Toggle sidebar
- **ESC**: Stop current AI generation

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Libraries Used
- **p5.js (0.9.0)**: Canvas and drawing functionality
- **ml5.js (0.4.3)**: SketchRNN model integration
- **Font Awesome**: Icons and visual elements

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- HTML5 Canvas support
- WebGL support (recommended)
- Minimum screen resolution: 768x600

### Performance Notes
- Initial model loading: 3-10 seconds
- Model switching: 2-5 seconds per model
- Canvas performance: Optimized for 60fps drawing
- Memory usage: ~50-100MB depending on model

## 🎯 Differences from Official Demo

### Enhanced Features
1. **Better UI**: Professional interface vs basic demo
2. **More Models**: 12+ models vs limited selection
3. **Full Control**: Temperature, save, clear, etc.
4. **Mobile Support**: Touch-optimized vs desktop-only
5. **Better Feedback**: Loading states, error handling
6. **Accessibility**: Keyboard shortcuts, screen reader support

### Maintained Compatibility
- Uses same ml5.js SketchRNN implementation
- Compatible with official model weights
- Same drawing format and prediction logic
- Maintains original drawing quality

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Model Loading Slow**: First load can take 5-15 seconds
2. **Canvas Not Responsive**: Try refreshing the page
3. **Touch Not Working**: Ensure you're on HTTPS or localhost
4. **Models Not Switching**: Wait for current model to finish loading

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support, recommended
- **Firefox**: Full support with good performance
- **Safari**: Supported, may be slower on iOS
