# Research Foundation: Human-Machine Collaboration

A modern, slide-style presentation webpage exploring human-machine collaboration in computational design practices. This project presents research foundations through an interactive, full-screen experience with smooth transitions and modern design aesthetics.

## Features

- **Full-screen slide presentation** with 16:9 aspect ratio optimization
- **Smooth scroll transitions** with scroll-snap functionality
- **Interactive navigation** with keyboard controls and click navigation
- **Progress indicator** showing presentation progress
- **Responsive design** adapting to different screen sizes
- **Modern aesthetic** with dark/light theme variations
- **Animated content** with fade-in effects on scroll

## Content Structure

### Core Concepts

The presentation explores three fundamental concepts in human-machine collaboration:

1. **Agency (代理)** - Distributed control and autonomous action
   - Example: Telephonic Arm Wrestling (1986) by Norman White
   
2. **Prediction (预测)** - Anticipatory systems and behavioral modeling
   - Example: SEEK (1969-70) by Nicholas Negroponte
   
3. **Interaction (交互)** - Embodied communication and empathetic interfaces
   - Example: Mimus (2017) by Madeline Gannon

### Slides Overview

1. **Title Slide** - Introduction to research foundation
2. **Research Questions** - Core inquiries and keywords
3. **Three Concepts** - Overview of Agency, Prediction, Interaction
4. **Agency Example** - Telephonic Arm Wrestling case study
5. **Prediction Example** - SEEK installation analysis
6. **Interaction Example** - Mimus robot exploration
7. **Methods & Approach** - Research methodology and framework
8. **Future Trajectories** - Vision for empathetic collaboration

## Navigation

- **Scroll** - Use mouse wheel or trackpad to navigate between slides
- **Keyboard** - Arrow keys (↑/↓) or spacebar to move through slides
- **Navigation Dots** - Click the dots on the right side to jump to specific slides
- **Progress Bar** - Top bar shows current position in presentation

## Technical Features

- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** for responsive layouts
- **CSS Custom Properties** for consistent theming
- **Intersection Observer API** for scroll-triggered animations
- **Scroll Snap API** for precise slide positioning
- **SVG graphics** for scalable visual elements
- **Modern CSS animations** with cubic-bezier easing

## Browser Compatibility
