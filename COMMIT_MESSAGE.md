# Hand Drawing with SketchRNN - Complete Implementation

## 🎨 Project Overview
Created a comprehensive web application that combines real-time hand tracking with AI-powered drawing completion using SketchRNN. Users can draw with hand gestures and have AI complete their artwork.

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 🤏 Hand Gesture Recognition
- **Index finger pointing** - Drawing brush control
- **Pinch gesture** (thumb + index) - Button clicking
- **Open palm** - Canvas clearing
- 1-second gesture delay for stability

### 🤖 AI Drawing Integration
- SketchRNN models for: Flower, Cat, Pig, Face
- Random category selection with display
- AI completion after 3+ user strokes
- Fallback geometric drawings if AI fails

### 🎮 User Interface
- Fullscreen canvas for immersive drawing
- Live camera feed (top-right corner)
- Category selection buttons (left side)
- Real-time gesture indicator
- Debug panel with system status
- Comprehensive English instructions

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- ml5.js HandPose for hand tracking
- MediaPipe for computer vision
- HTML5 Canvas for drawing
- Modern async/await patterns
- Robust error handling and recovery
- HTTPS/localhost detection

## 🛠️ Problem Solving

### Camera Access Issues
- Added proper video loading sequence
- Implemented HTTPS requirement checks
- Created retry mechanism with cleanup
