# NYC Urban Forest - Geospatial Structures Project Summary

## Project Overview
Created an interactive geospatial visualization of New York City's street trees using the 2015 TreesCount! Census data. The project demonstrates how geospatial structures can transform environmental data into meaningful, situated visual narratives.

## Key Features

### Data & Context
- **Dataset**: NYC Parks & Recreation 2015 Street Tree Census
- **Sample Size**: 5,000 trees (randomly sampled from 666,134 total)
- **Geographic Coverage**: All five NYC boroughs
- **Meaningful Context**: Urban forestry and environmental health

### Visual Design Excellence
- **Aesthetic Approach**: Dark theme with health-based color coding
- **Typography**: Inter font family for modern readability  
- **Color Palette**: Green-to-red gradient representing tree health
- **Composition**: Asymmetrical layout with floating information panels
- **Line Weights**: Variable point sizes (3-12px) based on trunk diameter

### Interactive Features
- **Hover Effects**: Dynamic highlighting with stroke width changes
- **Click Popups**: Detailed tree information cards
- **Smooth Transitions**: Opacity changes during navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout for all devices

### Technical Implementation
- **Mapping Engine**: Mapbox GL JS for high-performance WebGL rendering
- **Data Format**: GeoJSON for efficient web mapping
- **Styling**: CSS3 with backdrop filters and gradients
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth interaction with 5,000+ points

## Geospatial Applications

### Urban Planning
- Climate resilience planning through tree coverage analysis
- Green infrastructure development and maintenance
- Environmental justice mapping and policy advocacy

### Public Health Research  
- Correlation studies between tree density and health outcomes
- Air quality improvement planning
- Mental health and green space accessibility research

### Smart City Integration
- IoT sensor integration for real-time environmental monitoring
- Predictive maintenance scheduling for urban forestry
- Resource optimization for parks and recreation departments

## Project Significance
This visualization demonstrates how geospatial structures can make complex environmental data accessible and actionable. By combining meaningful NYC tree census data with thoughtful design and modern web technologies, the project creates a compelling narrative about urban environmental health that can inform policy, engage communities, and support research initiatives.
